:wq### 1. **Album-based Auto-Population**
- **Goal**: Leverage album information to pre-populate names
- **Implementation**: Read the albums listed in the right panel (e.g., "Laura", "Family 2024") and suggest names from names.json that match
- **Benefit**: Faster tagging - album name often indicates who should be tagged
- **Example**: If in "Laura's Birthday" album, auto-suggest "Laura" when moving to next imagee

uses the names.json to assign a group of names, almost the same code, except it strips the number out along with the ()s

example:

        "(1) Dennis Laura ",
        "(2) Dennis Bekah ",
        "(3) Dennis Steph "

the "(1) " would be stripped before sending to google photos, the trailing space, as with the names would remain untouched.
