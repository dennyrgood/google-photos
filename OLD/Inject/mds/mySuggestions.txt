Hitting the backspace now longer work, nor does shift backspace

no action occurs

uses the names.json to assign a group of names, almost the same code, except it strips the number out along with the ()s

example:

        "(1) Dennis Laura ",
        "(2) Dennis Bekah ",
        "(3) Dennis Steph "

the "(1) " would be stripped before sending to google photos, the trailing space, as with the names would remain untouched.
