                         QUICK START TESTING GUIDE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT WAS FIXED THIS SESSION
════════════════════════════

1. BACKSPACE NOW WORKS
   - Press BackSpace key → should delete last character

2. DELETE NOW WORKS  
   - Press Delete key → should delete last character

3. SHIFT+DELETE CLEARS DESCRIPTION
   - Press Shift+Delete → should clear entire description instantly

4. SPACE KEY IMPROVED
   - Type text with spaces → should add single space per keystroke

5. BROWSER AUTO-LAUNCHES
   - Launch app → browser should start automatically (no manual button)

6. NO DUPLICATE SPLASH SCREENS
   - Only one help dialog on manual launch, none on auto-launch


QUICK VERIFICATION (5 MINUTES)
════════════════════════════

Step 1: Launch the application
   $ python3 inject.py
   Expected: UI appears + browser starts automatically

Step 2: Navigate to a photo (if needed)
   - Wait for browser to open Google Photos
   - Log in if needed
   - Navigate to any photo with descriptions

Step 3: Test text input with spaces
   Type: "this is test"
   Expected: All characters and spaces appear correctly

Step 4: Test backspace
   Type: "test"
   Press: BackSpace 4 times
   Expected: Text disappears one character at a time

Step 5: Test delete
   Type: "test"
   Press: Delete key
   Expected: Last character disappears (like backspace)

Step 6: Test shift+delete
   Type: "long description here"
   Press: Shift+Delete
   Expected: Entire text disappears instantly

Step 7: Test keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+D)
   Press: Ctrl+D
   Expected: "Dennis " added to description

Step 8: Test next photo (Ctrl+N)
   Press: Ctrl+N
   Expected: Goes to next photo


FULL TESTING SUITE (15 MINUTES)
════════════════════════════

BASIC TESTS:
☐ App launches without clicking button
☐ Browser opens automatically
☐ Regular text input works
☐ Spaces work correctly (no doubles)
☐ Backspace deletes one character
☐ Delete key works like backspace
☐ Shift+Delete clears description
☐ Ctrl+D adds "Dennis"
☐ Ctrl+N goes to next photo
☐ Ctrl+P goes to previous photo

EDGE CASES:
☐ Empty description + backspace = nothing happens
☐ Single character + backspace = clears it
☐ Very long description + shift+delete = clears all instantly
☐ Type rapidly with spaces = all characters appear
☐ Try Tab key = adds "Dennis"
☐ Try comma = adds ", "
☐ Try period = adds ". "
☐ Try arrow keys = navigate photos

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:
☐ Ctrl+L = adds Laura
☐ Ctrl+B = adds Bekah
☐ Ctrl+S = adds Steph
☐ Ctrl+T = adds Tim
☐ Ctrl+C = adds Creighton
☐ Ctrl+J = adds Jeff
☐ Ctrl+G = adds Graeme
☐ Ctrl+H = adds Sarah


KNOWN REMAINING ISSUES
════════════════════════

1. Space bar may still trigger Google Photos next
   - Workaround: Use Ctrl+N instead
   - Fix: See FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS_CURRENT.md Item 11

2. Cursor after group shortcuts (Ctrl+1-9)
   - Minor issue, doesn't affect functionality


IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK
═════════════════════════

Check these in order:

1. Is the browser open?
   → Look for browser window in background

2. Is the description field focused?
   → Click on the description textarea in the browser

3. Are you using the right keyboard shortcut?
   → Check against KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS above

4. Does it work with a button click?
   → Try clicking the button instead of using keyboard

5. Check the console output
   → Look for error messages starting with [ERROR]

6. Restart the application
   → Close and run: python3 inject.py


WHAT TO REPORT IF ISSUES FOUND
═══════════════════════════════

For each issue, provide:
1. What you tried to do
2. What happened
3. What you expected to happen
4. Any error messages from console output
5. The keyboard key combination used
